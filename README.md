# Non_uniform_sampling
Non_uniform_sampling implements a complete mammography pipeline: resize &amp; segment VinDr-Mammo, build S/S10 patch datasets, train a patch classifier, create heatmaps, and perform saliency-guided non-uniform warping (controlled by scale and FWHM) for a whole-image classifier. Reproducible scripts + figures included.
